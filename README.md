Responsive sortable table

This was a challenge, where given a json file with data, the following frontend had to be done:

1.To create a responsive bootstrap grid with headers **city**, **start date**, **end date**, **price**, **status**, **color**.  All the Columns should be sortable.  

2. Above the grid, please add two date pickers to filter the object by date range.

3. Using [Angular-Chart.js](http://jtblin.github.io/angular-chart.js/), create a chart using some of the properties of the data above.

For the challenge, I didn't use any package manager, all needed libraries have been downloaded.

To see the result, you just need to download this files or clone the repo

git clone git@github.com:carolinagc/evt-fe-challenge.git

and start a web server, to keep it simple I used Simple HTTPServer, if Ubuntu is installed by default
so you just have to run in the console

$python -m SimpleHTTPServer
